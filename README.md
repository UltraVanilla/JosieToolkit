### How do I comply with networked code copyleft in a game?

If you are running modified versions of this software on a server with a game like Minecraft, Minetest, or Hytale, you must provide source code to your users. Here are some recommended ways to do this:

**Method 1:** Near your server contact email address

Mojang requires that all servers must include a contact email address. Include a link to your modified source code close to this.

**Method 2:** `/plugins` and `/version` commands

Paper servers include a `/plugins` command that shows a list of plugins, and a `/version` command showing plugin details. You may include `name`, `authors`, `website` properties in `build.gradle.kts` under `paper {` to rename the plugin to something unique, and publish your source code publicly under the provided URL.

**Method 3:** Ingame sign

Include a sign near the spawn location of your server that mentions how to acquire the source code for your modified plugin.
